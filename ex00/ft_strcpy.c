/* If the destination string of a strcpy() is not large enough, then anything 
might happen. Over‚Äêflowing fixed-length string buffers is a favorite cracker 
technique for taking complete control of the machine.  Any time a program reads 
or copies data into a buffer, the program first needs to  check  that there's 
enough space.  This may be unnecessary if you can show that overflow is
impossible, but be careful: programs can get changed over time, in ways that 
may make the  impossible possible. */
